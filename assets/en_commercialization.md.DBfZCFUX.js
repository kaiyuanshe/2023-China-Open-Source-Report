Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the Commercialization chapter of the Open-source Annual Report for the past two years, the underlying drivers of successful commercialization of open-source software, possible commercialization paths for open-source software companies, decision making criteria of investors in open-source projects, and case studies are presented. Last year, combined with some trends and changes in the market environment at that time, we discussed the drivers, challenges and realization paths for domestic open-source projects to explore the process of globalizationand commercial development, which triggered a lively discussion among many open-source buddies.</p><p>In 2022-2023, the field of AI has seen an explosion of pre-trained large language model (LLM) technology, which has sparked widespread interest across society and is predicted to continue to deepen its impact on life and work in the future. It is not difficult to find that in this wave of AI technology iteration, the open-source ecosystem has also played a essential role in promoting the development of technology, and there are many open-source models as well as open-source projects actively seeking commercialization. However, there are numerous differences between open-source models and traditional open-source software. In such an era, the commercial development of AI open-source projects and open-source models has become a topic worthy of in-depth research and discussion.</p><p>The security and controllability of open-source projects, including open-source software and open-source models, is one of the key considerations for business users in the commercialization process. Combined with the current technology trends, the analysis of the security of open-source software, the controllability of open-source models, and open-source commercial licenses are topics of interest.</p><p>Capital is an important participant in promoting the development of open-source markets. For investment institutions, when judging an open-source project, they will often consider the following points：In the product development stage, the focus should be on whether the team has the ownership and control of the code, and whether it has international competitiveness; in the community operation stage, the main point is to see whether the operating ability is strong enough; in the commercialization stage, the market matching ability and the maturity of the business model will become the main focus.</p><p>As the first organization in the field to focus on open-source and continue to work on it, Yunqi Partners has successfully identified and invested in open-source companies such as PingCAP, Zilliz, Jina AI, RisingWave Lab, TabbyML, etc., and continues to participate in the construction of the open-source ecosystem.</p><p>In order to further enrich the content of the report, this year we are honored to jointly organize a series of closed-door discussion Meetup with Open-source Society. We had a deep discussion on the development of open-source commercialization related to the development of AI Infrastructure, the development of open-source LLMs, together with industry guests including Microsoft, Google, Apple, Meta, Huawei, Baidu and other domestic and international manufacturers, Stanford University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China University of Science and Technology, UCSD and other universities and research institutes, as well as a large number of domestic and international front-line entrepreneurs open-source open-source LLMSome of the key insightsare included in this report.</p><p>This chapter is written by the investment team of Yunqi Partners, the topics discussed this year focusing oncutting-edge trends and technology, together with some outlookand prediction.We combined industry participants experience and opinions to put forward our views, if there are inconsiderate or different ideas, further discussion is highly welcomed.</p><p>Key elements include：</p><p><strong>Open source ecosystem for rapid AI growth</strong></p><p><strong>Open source security challenges</strong></p><p><strong>Capital market situation for open source projects</strong></p><h2 id="_2-open-source-ecosystem-fuels-rapid-ai-development" tabindex="-1">2.

These models, not only are growing in scale, but also have made huge leaps in their intelligent processing capabilities. From the complexity of the language processing to the finesse of image processing, and the depth of advanced data analysis, these models demonstrate unprecedented capability and precision. Especially in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), pre-trained LLM, such as the GPT series, have been able to simulate complex human languages by learning a large amount of textual data for high-quality text generation, translation and comprehension. These models not only show significant improvements in expression fluency, but also show an increasing ability to understand context and capture subtle linguistic differences.</p><p>In addition, these LLMs perform extremely well in complex data analysis. They are capable of extracting meaningful patterns and correlations from huge data sets to support a wide range of fields such as scientific research, financial analysis, and market forecasting. It is worth noting that the development of these models is not limited to their own enhancements. As they are popularized and applied, they are driving technological advances across the industry and society as a whole, facilitating the creation of new applications such as intelligent assistants, automated writing tools, advanced diagnostic systems, etc. Their development opens up more new development directions for incoming AI applications and research, indicating a new round of technological innovation.</p><p>Enthusiasm for AI among public users is surging rapidly. Number of ChatGPT users reached 100 million in just 2 months, compared to TikTok&#39;s 9-month-record. This is not only a huge commercial success, but also a major milestone in the history of AI technology development.</p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:75%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_2/2-1.png" alt="image001"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',20),h=e("br",null,null,-1),p=e("p",null,"Along with the growing AI popularity, the global AI market size is also growing rapidly.

Open-source technology can promote the development of advanced AI functionality and alleviate pressure on SMEs. Open-source Language Models lower the entry barrier and save development time, enabling more researchers to access advanced AI technologies directly.</p><p>Based on efficient pre-trained models, developers can directly innovate and improve in a targeted way rather than being distracted from building the infrastructure. This concentration on innovation rather than infrastructure has greatly contributed to rapid technological advances and the expansion of applications. At the same time, sharing open-source models facilitates the dissemination of knowledge and technology, providing a platform for developers worldwide to learn and collaborate, which plays a crucial role in driving overall progress across the industry.</p><p><strong>Saving computational power and avoiding reinventing the wheels</strong></p><p>As the performance of the LLM continues to grow, so does its number of parameters, which has jumped 1,000 times in the past five years. According to estimates, ChatGPT chip demand reaches more than 30,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, corresponding to an initial investment of about 800 million U.S. dollars, with daily electricity costs of $50,000. The computational requirements for training are becoming more and more costly, so reinventing wheels over and over again is a massive waste of resources. Coupled with the U.S. ban on NVIDIA&#39;s A100/H100 supply to mainland China, it&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult for domestic companies to train on LLMs. The open-source pre-trained LLM has become a perfect choice, which can solve the current dilemma so that more companies can leverage LLMs for secondary development.</p><p>Four steps are required for LLM training：pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, and reinforcement learning. The computational time for pre-training occupies more than 99% of the entire training cycle. Thus, the open-source model can help developers of LLM platforms directly skip the steps, with 99% of the cost of investing limited funds and time in fine-tuning steps, which is a significant help to most application layer developers. Many SMEs need model service providers to customize models for them. The open-source ecosystem can save a lot of costs for the secondary development of LLMs and thus can give birth to many startups.</p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:100%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_2/2-7.png" alt="image007"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',17),D=a('<br><p><strong>Open source allows for exploration of a wider range of technological possibilities</strong></p><p>Whether the world-shattering Transformer model is the optimal solution is still unanswered, and whether the next best thing is an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is still in question.

Therefore, the human exploration of the LLM will be unrestricted to the local optimal solution and will promote the possibility of continuous development of AI technology in all directions.</p><h4 id="_2-2-2-demand-side-lowering-the-barriers-to-capture-the-market" tabindex="-1">2.2.2 Demand side: lowering the barriers to capture the market <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-2-demand-side-lowering-the-barriers-to-capture-the-market" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.2.2 Demand side: lowering the barriers to capture the market&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Open source models significantly reduce costs for model users</strong></p><p>Deploying an open-source model initially requires some investment, but as usage increases, it exhibits scale economy, and the cost of usage is more controllable compared to closed-source. If you have a usage scenario where the average daily request frequency has an upper limit, then directly invoking the API is less expensive. However, if you have a higher request frequency, deploying the open-source model is less costly, so you should choose the appropriate method based on your actual usage. <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:75%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_2/2-8.png" alt="image008"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',7),F=a('<br><p>Comparison of directly calling OpenAI&#39;s API and deploying Flan UL2 model on public cloud as an example：</p><p>According to the latest data from OpenAI&#39;s official website, using ChatGPT4 model, the input is $0.03 / 1000 tokens and the output is $0.06 / 1000 tokens. Considering the relationship between input and output and assuming an average cost of $0.04 / 1000 tokens, each token is about 3/4 of an English word, and the number of tokens in a request is equal to the prompt word + the output tokens. Assuming a block of text is 500 words, or about 670 tokens, the cost of a block of text is 670 x 0.004/1000 = $0.00268.</p><p>Suppose the open-source model is deployed on the AWS cloud, taking the Flan UL2 model with 20 billion parameters, as mentioned in the related tutorial published by AWS, as an example.

The Gateway costs about $1 / 1 million requests or $0.000001 per request.</li></ul><p>Based on the above data, it can be calculated that the total cost of the two is equal when the number of requests is 56,200 in a day. When the number of requests reaches 100,000 per day, the cost of using ChatGPT4 is about $268, while the cost of the open-source big model is $151; when the number of requests reaches 1,000,000 per day, the cost of using ChatGPT4 is about $2,680, while the cost of the open-source big model is $161. It can be found that the cost savings of the open-source big model are significant as the request volume increases.</p><p><strong>Open source improves the explanability and transparency of models and lowers the barrier to technology adoption</strong></p><p>Open-source models are more accessible for evaluation than closed models. Open-source models provide access to their pre-training results, and some even disclose their training datasets, model architectures, and more, making it easier for researchers and users to conduct in-depth analyses of the LLMs and comprehend their strengths and weaknesses. Scientists and developers worldwide can review, evaluate, explore, and understand each other&#39;s underlying principles, improving security, reliability, explanability, and trust. Sharing knowledge widely is crucial to promote technological progress and also helps to reduce the possibility of technology misuse. Closed-source models can only be evaluated through performance tests, essentially a &quot;black box.&quot; It is hard to measure the strengths and weaknesses, applicability scenarios, and other factors of the closed-source models, and their explanability and transparency are considerably lower than that of open-source models.</p><p>Closed-source models can face the risk of being questioned for their originality. Users cannot be sure that closed-source models are genuinely original, leading to concerns about copyright and sustainability issues. On the other hand, open-source models are more convincing to users because the code is available to validate their originality. According to Hugging Face technician comments, open-source models like Llama2, which have published details of training data, methods, labeling, and so on, are more transparent than the black box of closed-source LLMs. With transparency in the articles and the code, users know what&#39;s in there when they use it.</p><p>Higher explainability and transparency are conducive to enhancing users&#39; trust, especially business users, in the LLMs.</p><p><strong>Business users can realize specific needs with open source base models</strong></p><p>Business users have multiple types of specific needs, such as：industry-specific fine-tuning, local deployment to ensure privacy, and so on.</p><p>As the amount of LLM parameters continues to increase, the training cost continues to rise. There are better solutions than simply growing the LLM parameters to improve performance. On the contrary, fine-tuning for a specific problem can quickly improve the performance of LLM targeting to achieve better results with less effort. For example, WizardMath, an open-source LLM of mathematics fine-tuned by Microsoft based on LLaMA2, has only 70 billion parameters, but after testing on the GSM8k dataset, the mathematical ability of WizardMath directly beats that of several LLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude Instant 1, PaLM 2-540B, and so on, which fully shows the critical role of fine-tuning in improving the professional problem-solving ability of LLMs, which is also a significant advantage of the open-source LLM. <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:100%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_2/2-9.png" alt="image009"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',14),R=a('<br><p>Many business users have incredibly high data privacy requirements, and the ability to deploy open-source LLMs locally greatly protects business privacy. When clients call closed-source LLMs, the closed-source models always run on the servers of companies such as OpenAI. Clients can only send their data remotely to the servers of the LLM providers, which is very unfavorable to privacy protection. Enterprises in China also face related compliance issues. While the open-source LLM can be locally deployed, all the data is processed within the company owning the data, even allowing offline processing, significantly protecting the clients&#39; data security.</p><p><strong>Open source model facilitates long-lasting customer experience</strong></p><p>FCreating a reliable dataset for enterprises is crucial to keeping up with the constant changes in open-source models. Open-source models can be customized to fit an enterprise&#39;s specific needs, but this requires a high-quality dataset. By investing in a dataset, enterprises can fine-tune multiple models and avoid constantly replacing them with newer versions, which saves money in the long run, as the dataset does not need to be updated continuously. Enterprises can leverage the model&#39;s capabilities without incurring significant costs.</p><p>Open-source models are updated quickly to meet the changing needs of users. The power of R&amp;D in the open-source community quickly fills the shortcomings of open-source LLMs. LLaMA2 itself lacks a Chinese corpus, leading to unsatisfactory Chinese comprehension; however, only the day after LLaMA2 was made available, the first open-source Chinese LLaMA2 model, &quot;Chinese LLaMA27B&quot;, appeared in the community and could be downloaded and run. Adequate community power support can meet the different needs of users. In contrast, closed-source companies usually need help to take care of the distinct needs of various types of users comprehensively.</p><p><strong>Open source helps to capture market opportunities</strong></p><p>Open-source models are more accessible to users and can expand the market quickly due to their low barrier to entry. Stable Diffusion, an open-source image generation model, has become an essential competitor to MidJourney, a closed-source model, because of its large developer community and diverse application scenarios. Although not as good as MidJourney in some ways, Stable Diffusion has captured a significant share of the image generation market with its open-source and free features, making it one of the most popular image generation models. Its success has also brought widespread attention and investment to the companies after it, RunwayML and Stability AI.</p><h4 id="_2-2-3-ecological-side-converging-diversity-for-long-term-growth" tabindex="-1">2.2.3 Ecological Side：Converging Diversity for Long-Term Growth <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-3-ecological-side-converging-diversity-for-long-term-growth" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.2.3 Ecological Side：Converging Diversity for Long-Term Growth&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Open source facilitates large model companies to quickly seize ecological resources</strong></p><p>The low threshold and easy accessibility of open-source models will also help the models quickly capture relevant ecological resources. StableDiffusion is an open-source project that has received positive responses and support from many freelance developers worldwide. Many enthusiastic programmers were actively involved in building the easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI). Many LoRA modules have been developed to provide Stable Diffusion with features such as accelerated generating, more vivid images, etc. According to the official website of Stable Diffusion, one month after the release of Stable Diffusion 2.0, four of the top ten apps in the Apple App Store are AI painting apps based on Stable Diffusion. A thriving ecosystem has become the solid foundation of Stable Diffusion.</p><p>At the time of the original release of the open-source LLM LlaMA2, there were 5,600 projects on GitHub containing the &quot;LLaMA&quot; keyword and 4,100 projects containing the &quot;GPT4&quot; keyword. After two weeks, the LLaMA-related ecosystem has grown significantly, with 6,200 related projects compared to 4,400 &quot;GPT4&quot;-related projects. For LLM companies, ecosystem means markets, technological power, and inexhaustible driver for growth. With lower barriers, open source can grab ecological resources faster than closed-source models. Therefore, open-source LLM companies should seize this advantage, strengthen communication with community developers, and provide them with sufficient support to promote the rapid development of relevant ecosystems.</p><p><strong>Open source facilitates large model vendors to pry the market and gain business alliances</strong></p><p>After LLaMA2 was commercially open-sourced, Meta quickly cooperated with Microsoft and Qualcomm. As the major shareholder of OpenAI, Microsoft chose to collaborate with open-source vendor Meta, which means that open-source has become a force to be reckoned with.

According toiResearch, domestic enterprises are not professional enough in their internal management processes, have low recognition of the value of software, and are more willing to pay for manpower. Manufacturers need to curve to indoctrinate companies, give them a reprieve from accepting the product, and gradually unleash the demand side. Based on the above background, open-source tools meet the needs of these markets with their low-cost features, making organizations more willing to try and adopt these tools. For domestic companies with limited budgets, low cost is a significant advantage. Low- or no-cost features allow these organizations to access and use advanced technology tools without additional financial burden.</p><p>At the same time the low-cost nature of open-source tools encourages companies to make long-term investments. Firms can build and expand their technology infrastructure over time without taking on significant financial risk. With the deepening of the enterprise&#39;s understanding of open-source products and the deepening of the degree of dependence, open-source products can gradually consider providing value-added services content, so as to achieve the purpose of long-term customer acquisition.</p><p>At the same time open-source products are conducive to achieve seamless integration with other systems to enhance the user experience. A distinguishing feature of open-source application layer products is that they are often highly flexible and customizable. Allows users to modify and adapt to their specific needs. This means that open-source products can be customized to better fit existing systems and workflows for seamless integration with other systems. Many open-source projects follow industry standards, which helps ensure compatibility between different systems and components. Standardization promotes interoperability between different software products and simplifies the integration process, thereby improving the overall user experience. Open-source communities are typically made up of developers and users from around the world who work together to improve products and provide support. This collaborative spirit not only fosters continuous improvement of the product, but also provides a resource for solving problems that may be encountered during the integration process.</p><p><strong>Open-source application layer products can receive contributions from the community to facilitate technology iteration and broaden the application scenarios</strong></p><p>Application layer open-source can receive strong support from community development forces. As the application scenarios are more diverse and decentralized, the needs of different sub-scenarios are more differentiated, and the expertise of contributors to the corresponding scenarios is more demanding. Stable Diffusion (SD) is an open-source text-to-image application that, with the power of the community, has been rapidly catching up in terms of performance since its release and in some ways surpassing the closed-source text-to-image application Midjourney. While there are some inconveniences when using Stable Diffusion, users have access to hundreds of LoRAs, fine-tuning settings, and text embeds from the community. For example, users of Stable Diffusion found it to be limited in its ability to process hand images. In response, the community reacted quickly and within the next few weeks a LoRA fix was developed specifically for the hand image issue. This timely and professional feedback from the community greatly contributes to the rapid advancement and improvement of application layer open-source tools.</p><p>Open-source products, due to a lower barrier to use, may be adopted by users from different industries and backgrounds in a variety of environments and contexts as soon as they are released. These application scenarios may go far beyond the developer&#39;s initial design and imagination. When products are used in these diverse scenarios, they may reveal new potential or needs, revealing previously unnoticed usage scenarios. This can provide product developers with valuable insights into how their products are performing in real-world use and potential room for improvement. Faced with these newly discovered usage scenarios, developers have the opportunity to innovate and improve.They can add new features, optimize existing features, or redesign products to better meet these needs based on actual user experience in different environments. The iteration based on real-world use cases, is a key driver for the continued progress of open-source products.</p><p><strong>Application layer open-source products have Product-Led Growth (PLG) model features that can drive paid conversions</strong></p><p>The PLG model focuses on customer acquisition through a bottom-up sales model, where the product is at the center of the entire sales process. The PLG model&#39;s growth flywheel has three main phases：Acquisition, Conversion, and Retention. In all three phases, open-source has advantages that distinguish it from traditional business models.</p><p>In the customer acquisition phase, the open-source operating model reduces the cost of customer acquisition and makes the customer acquisition process more targeted. The interactions between developers and the community-based collaboration brought about by platforms such as GitHub accelerate the spread of customer acquisition. The initial customer orientation of open-source products is usually participants in the open-source community, often developers or IT staff in the organization. By nurturing these quality prospects, you also have a &quot;mass base&quot;. Communities help open up the boundaries of the enterprise and make word-of-mouth spreading of good open-source projects and products possible. Users spontaneously download and use it in order to solve their own problems and pain points. At this point, open-source software products are not just used as a way to solve user problems through functionality, but can also be a vehicle to help organizations spread and grow. In the long run, it will be possible to reduce the cost of customer acquisition for your organization, allowing for more and more automated customer acquisition and lowering expenses on the sales side.</p><p>At the conversion stage, open-source software tends to have a higher paid conversion rate compared to traditional commercial software. On the one hand, when the user has used the free version of the software, as long as the software&#39;s functions can well meet the user&#39;s needs, it can be converted into a paid conversion at the speed of a shorter cycle, and make it a long-term user. On the other hand, companies can conduct targeted conversion follow-up and up-selling by observing users&#39; behavior with the free version of the software, for example, by providing the sales team with a list of customers who have exceeded their usage limits and are ready to pay. In addition to traditional sales conversions, conversions can also be made through self-service buying paths (Self-service selling), which largely reduces the cost of sales.</p><p>In the retention phase, open-source software allows users to avoid the risk of vendor lock-in, making them willing to engage in long-term use. Based on the same open-source project, there may be multiple vendors downstream that offer software with similar functionality, and the choice of vendor can be changed at a relatively small cost, so users can be confident in their choice of software for the long term. On the contrary, when a customer uses a closed-source product, if he/she wants to switch to another software after a period of time, he/she needs to redeploy hardware, data, etc., resulting in a significant transfer cost. Thus when users choose to use closed-source software, they may abandon their continued use of the software because the software&#39;s later development does not meet their needs or the cost of transferring it is too high. <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_2/2-28.png" alt="image028"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',15),Be=a('<br><h4 id="_2-4-3-market-status-of-llm-application-layer-open-source" tabindex="-1">2.4.3 Market Status of LLM Application Layer Open Source <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-4-3-market-status-of-llm-application-layer-open-source" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.4.3 Market Status of LLM Application Layer Open Source&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Internet giants and startups working together</strong></p><p>There are opportunities for both Internet giants and startups to participate and compete in the LLM application layer open-source market. This is due to several factors：1) The lowered technology barrier. The open-source of the modeling layer and developer tools layer lowers the threshold of technology acquisition and application. Instead of having to develop complex LLM algorithms from scratch, startups can utilize open-source models and tools to develop solutions that meet specific needs. 2) Cost-effectiveness. Open-source models often do not require costly licenses or API fees, which is especially beneficial for SMEs with relatively limited capital. 3) Innovation and flexibility. Startups are often able to adapt more quickly to market changes and innovate for specific market segments or application scenarios.</p><p>At present, the Internet giants are mainly based on the LLM, on which they extend a series of vertical applications. For example, Ali&#39;s Tongyi Qianwen recently released Tongyi Qianwen 2.0 and derived eight applications based on it：Tongyi Tingwu (speech recognition), Tongyi Xiaomei (improving customer service efficiency), Tongyi Zhiwen (understanding text), Tongyi Stardust (personalized roles), Tongyi Lingyi (assisted programming), Tongyi Faryi (legal industry), Tongyi Renshen (pharmaceutical industry), and Tongyi Dijin (financial industry).</p><p>Startups mainly choose a certain niche industry for deep cultivation, such as Lanboat Technology&#39;s self-developed LLM focusing on marketing, finance, cultural creativity and other scenarios; XrayGPT focusing on medical radiology image analysis; Finchat focusing on financial field models, etc. Yunqi Partners has supported two open-source application layer startups this year, TabbyML, a tool to aid programming, and Realchar, an AI personal assistant that allows for real-time customization, both of which have quickly amassed a large number of users on Github.</p><p><strong>Competitive landscapes in Business-end and Consumer-end are different</strong></p><p>Significant differences in the competitive landscape between the business-end and consumer-end of the open-source market for LLM application layers：</p><ul><li><strong>To-Business Markets</strong>：Enterprise-oriented applications are typically focused on improving efficiency, reducing costs, and enhancing decision-making capabilities. In this area, open-source LLMs can be used to automate processes, data analytics, customer service optimization, and more. The competition here focuses more on the practicality of the technology and the ability to customize it.</li><li><strong>To-Consumer Markets</strong>：Consumer-oriented applications are more focused on user experience, interactivity and ease of use. This includes personalized recommendations, virtual assistants, entertainment and social media apps, and more. Competition in the consumer market is more about innovative user interfaces and new features that appeal to users.</li></ul><p><strong>Large number of sub-scenarios still belong to the blue ocean market, no obvious lead</strong></p><p>As technology evolves, market demand for AI applications becomes more segmented.For example, in industries such as healthcare, law, finance, and education, each field has its own unique needs and challenges. These market segments offer a great deal of opportunity, but also require targeted solutions.There are a number of relevant applications emerging in each of these areas, but most are at the start-up stage and have yet to produce a headline application. And because there are so many segments of the industry, there is not much competition, making it a better opportunity to get in. In these blue ocean markets, no clear market leader has yet formed due to the novelty and constant evolution of the market. This provides opportunities for new entrants and innovators to capture market share through unique solutions or innovative business models.</p><p><strong>Expect innovative applications to emerge based on the new capabilities of LLMs</strong></p><p>Although significant progress has been made in LLM technology, its deep integration and innovative application in specific application areas is still in its infancy. This means that there is plenty of room to explore and implement new ways of applying it in many sub-scenarios.With the rapid development of large-scale AI models, we are ushering in a new era of potential and innovation. These models will not only optimize and improve existing technology applications, but more importantly, they will be pioneers in leading completely new markets and application areas. In a future full of unknowns and surprises, we can look forward to the emergence of a huge variety of powerful new applications that will be integrated into our daily lives in unprecedented ways. These emerging markets and applications will open a window into never-before-seen possibilities for far-reaching social and cultural change. They will stimulate human creativity and imagination, pushing us to break through existing technological boundaries and explore a wider world.</p><p>In this dynamic and innovative era, we will witness the seamless integration of technology into our daily lives and experience the convenience and efficiency that comes with intelligence. The synergy between humans and machines will open up new modes of cooperation and innovation, leading us to a smarter, more efficient, and more personalized future. It&#39;s a time of great anticipation, with every step of technological advancement building a more exciting, rich and diverse world for us. In this new era, we will witness and create unprecedented miracles together, and explore together the infinite possibilities of the common development of science and technology and mankind.</p><h3 id="_2-5-the-commercialization-of-open-source-llms-is-encountering-difficulties" tabindex="-1">2.5 The commercialization of open-source LLMs is encountering difficulties <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-the-commercialization-of-open-source-llms-is-encountering-difficulties" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.5 The commercialization of open-source LLMs is encountering difficulties&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_2-5-1-technology-is-evolving-at-a-rapid-pace-and-open-source-projects-need-to-be-continuously-iterated-to-remain-competitive" tabindex="-1">2.5.1 Technology is evolving at a rapid pace and open-source projects need to be continuously iterated to remain competitive <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-1-technology-is-evolving-at-a-rapid-pace-and-open-source-projects-need-to-be-continuously-iterated-to-remain-competitive" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.5.1 Technology is evolving at a rapid pace and open-source projects need to be continuously iterated to remain competitive&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In the field of artificial intelligence and LLMs, technology is evolving at an extremely fast pace with new algorithms, data processing techniques, optimization methods, and computational architectures continue to emerge. For open-source projects, this means that constant updates and upgrades are needed to keep the technology current and effective. This need for continuous updating is a challenge in terms of resources and time.For open-source projects, especially those with relatively limited financial and human resources, it can be challenging to keep up with this rapid pace of technology iteration. This means that not only do they have to race against the clock, but they also face stiff competition from commercial companies and other open-source projects. If a project is not kept up to date to reflect the latest technological advances, it can quickly become obsolete and thus lose the interest and support of users and community members.</p><p>In the face of well-funded companies from some tech giants such as OpenAI and Ali, some of the LLMs that small and medium-sized companies have spent a lot of money on developing could be quickly surpassed, leading to a serious funding gap. A &quot;burn-in&quot; strategy is possible for large vendors that small and medium-sized companies can&#39;t afford, which could potentially discourage the current 100-flower LLM market and reduce its diversity.</p><h4 id="_2-5-2-difficulty-in-defining-the-scope-of-plagiarism-inspiration" tabindex="-1">2.5.2 Difficulty in defining the scope of plagiarism / inspiration <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-2-difficulty-in-defining-the-scope-of-plagiarism-inspiration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.5.2 Difficulty in defining the scope of plagiarism / inspiration&quot;">​</a></h4><p>The original intention of open-source LLMs was to allow more users to access and use LLMs, but in the process of using them, disputes often arise over code attribution, licenses, and many other issues. Since LLM open-source is a relatively new concept, the relevant legal and regulatory system is not perfect, and many of them also involve cross-border issues, there is no clear definition of the boundary about whether LLM is plagiarized or borrowed. The recent Zero One Everything issue regarding LLaMA&#39;s &quot;Shell Controversy&quot; has generated a lot of attention. At the heart of the disagreement, but not the final judgment, is the difficulty of defining the scope of plagiarism / borrowing.</p><p>Some argue that Zero One Everything&#39;s software uses Llama&#39;s source code without attributing it, making it appear that they developed that part of the content themselves, and is indeed suspected of violating the right of attribution, i.e., suspected of plagiarism. However, there is also the view that the structural design of the Zero One Everything LLM is based on a mature structure that draws on the publicly available results of the industry&#39;s top level. Since the development of the LLM technology is still at a very early stage, keeping the structure consistent with the industry&#39;s mainstream will be more conducive to the overall adaptation and future iteration. Meanwhile the Zero One Everything team has done a lot of work on understanding models and training, and is also continuing to explore breakthroughs in the nature of the structural level of models.</p><p>This identification becomes even more complex in a context where LLMing technologies are still in their infancy and laws and regulations are not yet perfect. We should recognize that, with the continuous evolution of technology and the improvement of the legal system, how to balance the protection of innovation and the promotion of cooperation will be a process that needs to be continuously explored and improved.Ultimately, this is not only a legal and technical issue, but also an ethical and moral issue that concerns the healthy development of the entire industry.</p><h4 id="_2-5-3-difficulty-for-community-participants-to-provide-direct-contributions-to-model-iterations" tabindex="-1">2.5.3 Difficulty for community participants to provide direct contributions to model iterations <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-3-difficulty-for-community-participants-to-provide-direct-contributions-to-model-iterations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.5.3 Difficulty for community participants to provide direct contributions to model iterations&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In the process of building and iterating large-scale AI models, participants in the eco-community face a notable challenge：Due to the complexity of model training, it is often difficult for them to contribute directly to the development of the models. These LLMs, such as Llama or other advanced machine learning models, typically require highly specialized technical knowledge and resources, including large-scale data-processing capabilities, deep algorithmic understanding, and expensive hardware resources.For ordinary community members, these demands are often beyond their means.</p><p>As a result, while community members may be enthusiastic and willing to participate, they are limited in their ability to substantially iterate on the model. This lack of expertise means that even the most active community members may only be able to play a role in relatively peripheral areas such as model application, feedback collection, or elementary debugging. This limitation not only affects the extent to which the community contributes to the development of the model, but may also lead to a weakened sense of community involvement and belonging during the model development process. Finding appropriate ways to enable a wider range of community participants to contribute their wisdom and efforts effectively is therefore an important topic in the development of the LLM.</p><h4 id="_2-5-4-rapid-development-of-open-source-technology-and-high-cost-of-late-updates" tabindex="-1">2.5.4 Rapid development of open source technology and high cost of late updates <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-5-4-rapid-development-of-open-source-technology-and-high-cost-of-late-updates" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2.5.4 Rapid development of open source technology and high cost of late updates&quot;">​</a></h4><p>One of the main advantages of open-source software is that it reduces the initial cost to the user. Enterprises can acquire and use open-source LLMs without paying expensive license fees. This is especially attractive to small businesses or startups with limited budgets, as they can utilize advanced technology without a significant financial burden. While open-source software saves money in the initial phase, they can come with higher update costs over the long run.</p><p>Open-source projects are often known for their speed of innovation and community-driven dynamism, which drives technology to progress and evolve. However, as technology rapidly updates and iterates, the cost of maintaining and upgrading existing systems increases. Such costs include not only direct financial inputs, such as hardware upgrades or the purchase of new services, but also indirect costs, such as training staff to adapt to new technologies and the time and labor involved in migrating existing systems to newer versions. Especially for long-term projects, it becomes especially challenging to keep up with the latest open-source technologies. Every major update or technology transition can involve complex adaptation efforts and compatibility testing that require significant human and technical resources. In addition, frequent updates may lead to system stability and security issues, increasing potential operational risks.</p><p>Therefore, while open-source technologies offer great advantages in terms of innovation and flexibility, organizations and developers must carefully consider the update costs associated with adopting and maintaining these technologies, and how to find a balance between continuous innovation and cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Although open-source LLMs currently face numerous challenges, such as the rapid development of technology iterations, the risk of plagiarism, the limitations of community contributions, and the increased cost of maintenance, their future remains promising.Open-source LLMs have shown great potential to drive technological innovation, facilitate knowledge sharing, and accelerate R&amp;D processes. In order to realize these potentials and overcome current challenges, a concerted effort by all parties from different fields and backgrounds is required!</p><h2 id="_3-open-source-security-challenges" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://hackmd.io/DAH6W1DsQK2xlfd4DoFfHA#3-Open-source-security-challenges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3.

The root causes of these security vulnerabilities usually lie in open-source code management and maintenance issues, such as programming errors, lack of continuous security reviews, and lagging application of updates and patches. Particularly where programs are not active enough or lack effective regulation, these vulnerabilities may go unrecognized or unfixed for long periods of time. Historically, several serious security incidents have occurred due to security vulnerabilities in open-source software, resulting in sensitive data breaches and financial losses.</p><p>In April 2014, a major security vulnerability in the widely used open-source component OpenSSL, known as Heartbleed, emerged. This vulnerability has existed since the May 2012 release and allows an attacker to obtain data containing certificate private keys, usernames, passwords, email addresses, and other sensitive information. Because this vulnerability went undetected for nearly two years, its impact was extremely widespread and almost impossible to accurately measure. Again, in December 2021, another widely used open-source component, Apache Log4j2, was found to have a serious remote code execution vulnerability called Log4Shell. This vulnerability quickly spread globally due to the high performance and low exploitation barrier of Apache Log4j2, affecting a number of well-known companies and service platforms, including Steam, Twitter, Amazon, and others.</p><h4 id="_3-1-2-the-relative-prevalence-of-open-source-software-cybersecurity-issues" tabindex="-1">3.1.2 The relative prevalence of open source software cybersecurity issues <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-1-2-the-relative-prevalence-of-open-source-software-cybersecurity-issues" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.1.2 The relative prevalence of open source software cybersecurity issues&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Open source software is inherently more vulnerable</strong></p><p>According to the results of &quot;2022 <a href="https://en.qianxin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">QiAnXin QAX</a> Open-source Project Inspection Program&quot;, the overall defect density of open-source software is 21.06/thousand lines, and the density of high-risk defects is 1.29/thousand lines. The number of defect densities and high-risk defect densities has been increasing for three consecutive years, with an accelerating trend. The overall detection rate of the ten categories of typical defects in open-source software was 72.3%, while this figure was only 56.3% two years ago. There is a rapid increase in the detection rate of open-source software, suggesting the security issue of the software itself is quite serious.</p><br><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:75%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_3/3-2.png" alt="image030"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',10),je=a('<br><p>In terms of the absolute number of open-source software flaws and vulnerabilities, according to data from <a href="https://en.qianxin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">QiAnXin (QAX)</a>, by the end of 2022, 57,610 vulnerabilities related to open-source software will be included in the public vulnerability database, and 7,682 new vulnerabilities will be added in 2022, an incremental increase of about 15%, which is a worrisome situation.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Expert Review</p><p><strong>Yu Jie</strong>：The security of open-source software urgently needs to be given sufficient attention, and it is clear that the strength of individual communities alone is not enough to deal with it.

These audits can be performed by assembling specialized security teams or utilizing third-party security services. These teams or service providers should have an in-depth understanding of open-source software.</p><p>Regular code review meetings are also held to encourage team members to review each other&#39;s code, which not only helps identify potential security issues, but also improves the team&#39;s programming skills and code quality. Audits and code review should be an continuous process, constantly monitoring and updating the code base in response to newly discovered vulnerabilities and security threats.</p><p><strong>Using the SCA (Software Component Analysis) tool</strong></p><p>Software Component Analysis (SCA) is a methodology for managing the security of open-source components, enabling development teams to quickly track and analyze the open-source components used in their projects. SCA tools identify all relevant components and supporting libraries, as well as direct and indirect dependencies between them. In addition, they can check software licenses, identify deprecated dependencies, and discover potential vulnerabilities and threats. A SCA scan produces a software bill of materials (SBOM) that contains a complete list of the project&#39;s software assets.</p><p>With the widespread use of open-source components in software development, SCA is emerging as a key component of application security, although the concept itself is not new. The number of SCA tools has grown with its importance. In modern software development practices, including DevSecOps, SCA not only needs to provide ease of use for developers, but also needs to guide and direct developers safely throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p><p>When using SCA for open-source security, the following points should be considered:</p><ul><li>Adopt developer-friendly SCA tools: Developers are often busy writing and optimizing code, and they need tools that promote efficient thinking and rapid iteration. Unfriendly SCA tools can slow down the development process. An easy-to-use SCA tool simplifies setup and operation. Such tools should integrate easily with existing development workflows and tools, and should be implemented early in the software development life cycle (SDLC). It is important that developers understand the importance of SCA and incorporate its security checking process into their daily work to minimize code rewrites due to security issues.</li><li>Integrate SCA into the CI/CD process: Using SCA tools does not mean that they will interfere with the development, testing, and production processes. Instead, organizations should integrate SCA scanning into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes so that vulnerabilities can be identified and remediated as a functional part of the software development and build process. This approach also helps developers make code security part of their daily workflow.</li><li>Effective Use of Reports and Software Bills of Materials: Many organizations, including the U.S. Federal Government, require a software bill of materials (SBOM) when purchasing software. Providing a detailed SBOM means that organizations recognize the importance of keeping track of every component within an application. Clear security scanning and remediation reports are also critical, as they provide detailed information about an organization&#39;s security practices and the number of vulnerabilities remediated, demonstrating a commitment to and actual action on software security.</li></ul><p><strong>Enhancing education and training</strong></p><p>Conduct regular security awareness training for developers to increase their knowledge of security threats and best security practices, including educating them on identifying common security vulnerabilities and attack tactics. Use hands-on simulation exercises and workshops to allow developers to learn how to handle security incidents in a secure environment. These exercises can include vulnerability mining, code remediation, and security testing.</p><p>Given the rapid changes in the security landscape, encourage developers to continuously learn and update their knowledge, including by participating in online courses, seminars and industry conferences. Create a platform, such as an internal forum or regular meetings, for developers to share their knowledge and experience in security to foster learning and collaboration among teams.</p><h3 id="_3-2-controllable-open-source-licences" tabindex="-1">3.2 Controllable open source licences <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-controllable-open-source-licences" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2 Controllable open source licences&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_3-2-1-open-source-licenses-are-a-constraint-on-users-of-open-source-resources-with-a-wide-range-of-categories" tabindex="-1">3.2.1 Open source licenses are a constraint on users of open source resources, with a wide range of categories <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-1-open-source-licenses-are-a-constraint-on-users-of-open-source-resources-with-a-wide-range-of-categories" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.1 Open source licenses are a constraint on users of open source resources, with a wide range of categories&quot;">​</a></h4><p>An open-source license is a binding for open-source resources (including, but not limited to, software, code, and web users). Based on the open-source license, the user gets the right to use, modify and share the open-source resources. If the software is not licensed, it means that the copyright is retained and the user can only view the source code and not use it. Therefore, an open-source license is essentially a legal permit that protects project contributors and users of open-source resources, ensures that contributors can open-source the resources they own in the way they want to, and also ensures that users can use the resources in a reasonable and legal way to avoid being caught in intellectual property disputes, which greatly contributes to the prosperity of the open-source community.</p><p>Open-source licenses are divided into three overall categories based on how restrictive the license is：Permissive, Weak Copyleft, Strong Copyleft <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:90%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_3/3-6.png" alt="image034"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',19),Xe=a('<br><p><strong>The Permissive category</strong> is the most flexible category of licenses, including BSD, MIT, Apache, ISC, etc., which provide extremely permissive licensing conditions that allow people to freely use, modify, copy, and distribute the software. They equally support the use of software for commercial or non-commercial purposes.The only requirement is that the appropriate license text and copyright information be included in each copy of the software.</p><p><strong>The Weak Copyleft category</strong> is a more restrictive license than the Permissive category, including LGPL, MPL, etc., which requires that any changes made to the code be released under the same license. Also, the modified code must contain the license and copyright information of the original code. However, they do not mandate that the entire project be released under the same license.</p><p><strong>The Strong Copyleft category</strong> is an even more restrictive type of license, including GPL, AGPL, CPL, etc. This type of license states that the entire project must be released under the same license, including those cases where only a portion of the software is used. In addition, these licenses require that all modified versions of the code be publicly released.</p><p>Under these broad categories, specific licenses and license families will have unique restrictions, permissions, and specific differences in additional parameters, and the overall logical relationship of licenses is organized as follows： <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:80%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_3/3-7.png" alt="image035"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',6),Ye=a('<br><p>Kaiyuanshe provides an open-source license filter, which provides good help to understand the best license options faster and better, and is highly recommended for readers who need it：<a href="https://kaiyuanshe.cn/tool/license-filter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://kaiyuanshe.cn/tool/license-filter</a></p><h4 id="_3-2-2-risk-of-infringement-by-using-open-source-resources-without-complying-with-the-license" tabindex="-1">3.2.2 Risk of infringement by using open source resources without complying with the license <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-2-risk-of-infringement-by-using-open-source-resources-without-complying-with-the-license" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.2 Risk of infringement by using open source resources without complying with the license&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Open source license infringement</strong></p><p>&quot;Open-source license infringement&quot; is the use of open-source software without complying with the terms and conditions of the open-source license associated with the software, thereby violating the legal constraints imposed by the license. Such behavior can lead to a host of legal and ethical problems. While open-source software is freely available to the public for use and modification, such use and modification is still subject to certain limitations, which are specified by the corresponding open-source license.</p><p>Specific instances include, but are not limited to, the following：</p><p>Ignoring Copyright Notices and Attribution：Many open-source licenses require that original copyright notices and author attributions be retained when copying, distributing, or modifying software. Ignoring this requirement, such as removing the original author&#39;s copyright information or failing to properly attribute the work, is considered an infringement.</p><p>Non-availability of Source Code：Some licenses, such as the GPL (General Public License), require that the source code be made available along with the distribution of the software. If a piece of software based on such a license is distributed without the source code being made available at the same time, this also constitutes infringement.</p><p>Restrictive Use：Some licenses have restrictions on the scenarios in which the software can be used. For example, certain licenses may prohibit the use of the software in certain types of business activities. Violation of these restrictive covenants is also a tort.</p><p>Violating Conditions for Distribution and Re-licensing：Copyleft open-source licenses such as the GPL requires that any modifications and derivative works based on GPL-licensed software must also be released under the GPL license. Violations of this rule, such as privatizing GPL code or distributing derivative works under non-GPL licenses, constitute copyright infringement.</p><p>Violation of Specific Terms：In addition to the common scenarios described above, there are specific license terms that may be violated under certain circumstances. This depends on the specific requirements of the particular license.</p><p><strong>License Reciprocity Requirement Leads to Expanded Scope of Open Source Copyright Problems</strong></p><p>The so-called &quot;reciprocity requirement&quot; of an open-source license, i.e., whether a derivative work follows the license of the original work, refers to the fact that the terms and conditions of an open-source license tend to continue to apply during the process of open sourcing the software, which includes copying, modifying, manipulating, redistributing, and displaying. The permissions and limitations of such licenses can extend vertically to derivative works and modified versions based on the original software development, and even horizontally affect other parts of the software developed based on such open-source software.</p><p>Of the many open-source licenses, the GPL has the strongest reciprocity requirements and the most lawsuits associated with it. The main reason for this is：Any derivative software based on GPL code modifications needs to be open source. If a piece of software contains GPL code, even if it is only a portion, the software as a whole is usually required to be open-source (unless it meets the terms of a specific exception). Failure to open-source portions of proprietary software affected by the GPL may result in infringement by the user in violation of the obligations of the GPL license. Moreover, the GPL is extremely complex, containing 17 terms. It has more stringent requirements for users, and once these requirements are violated, the user&#39;s license agreement is terminated and continued use of GPL-licensed open-source software may constitute copyright infringement. <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:90%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_3/3-8.png" alt="image036"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',15),et=a('<br><p><strong>Infringement of open source licenses may lead to serious consequences</strong></p><p>Once an open-source license is characterized as an infringement, the loss to the defendant company or individual is far more than just compensation payment, but also includes a series of issues such as reputation and partnership：</p><p>Lawsuits and Fines：In 2017, Versata Software sued Ameriprise Financial for violating Versata&#39;s patents. While this is not a pure case of open-source license infringement, it involves software licensing and copyright issues. The case eventually ended in a settlement, but the legal fees and time costs involved were prohibitive.</p><p>Enforcing Compliance with License Requirements：A famous case is the 2015 VMware vs. Hellwig case. Hellwig, a Linux kernel developer, accused VMware of using GPL-based Linux code in its ESXi products without following the open-source requirements of the GPL license. Although the court did not ultimately rule in Hellwig&#39;s favor, the case sparked a broader discussion about GPL license obligations and derivative works.</p><p>Reputational Damage：Red Hat filed a lawsuit against Speakeasy, Inc. in 2004 for allegedly failing to comply with the requirements of the GPL license. Despite the settlement of the case, Speakeasy&#39;s reputation has suffered, especially in the open-source community.</p><p>Business Impact：Cisco was sued by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) in 2008 for violating the GPL license for its Linksys products. Cisco ultimately agreed to comply with the GPL license and pay an undisclosed amount as a donation. The lawsuit led Cisco to reconsider its open-source strategy for its products.</p><p>Partnership Damage：a company is found to be in violation of an open-source license, its business partners may reevaluate their relationship with the company, especially if the collaborative project involves open-source software.</p><h4 id="_3-2-3-open-source-large-model-licenses-are-largely-distinct-from-traditional-licenses" tabindex="-1">3.2.3 Open source large model licenses are largely distinct from traditional licenses <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-3-open-source-large-model-licenses-are-largely-distinct-from-traditional-licenses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.3 Open source large model licenses are largely distinct from traditional licenses&quot;">​</a></h4><p>As open-source LLMs are still evolving and iterating, two highly influential open-source LLMs of the year：Llama2 and Falcon, have both been questioned as to whether or not they are truly &quot;open source&quot; due to tweaks to the terms of their open-source licenses. Both do not use commercially available licenses, but rather their own &quot;LLAMA 2 COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT&quot; and &quot;TII Falcon LLM License&quot;, respectively; and both impose additional restrictions on their commercial use. Both have additional restrictions on their commercial use.</p><p><strong>Difference in open source licenses for LLaMA2</strong></p><p>Much of the discussion of Llama2&#39;s violation of open-source guidelines comes from its more unique terms：</p><ul><li>The Llama2 open-source model may not be used in products or service platforms with monthly active MAUs greater than 700 million, unless approved and licensed by Meta;</li><li>The Llama2 open-source model may not be used in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations, including trade compliance laws. Also not applicable to use in languages other than English;</li><li>Other LLMs (not including Llama2 or its derivatives)</li></ul><p>The Open Source Initiative (OSI) has published ten definitions of open source, which are currently recognized internationally, and the Llama2 protocol conflicts with two of them</p><ul><li>Non-Discrimination Against Individuals or Groups：The Llama License prevents enterprise users with more than 700 million monthly users from obtaining licenses directly through this License.</li><li>Non-Discrimination Against Fields：The license shall not restrict anyone from using the program in a particular field. The Llama License prohibits the use of Llama2 outputs to improve other AI LLMs, which would be a restriction on the domain of use. Llama2&#39;s language restrictions also lead to limitations in the use of Chinese language domains.</li></ul><p><strong>Difference in open source licenses for Falcon</strong></p><p>The TII Falcon LLM License makes some key changes from the Apache License. The Apache License is a popular open-source license that is friendly to commercial use and allows users to distribute or sell their modified code as an open-source or commercial product after meeting certain conditions.</p><p>Falcon&#39;s license is similar to the Apache License in that it also provides broad permissions to use, modify, and distribute the licensed work, and requires that the license text be included in the distribution and properly attributed, in addition to a disclaimer of limitations of liability and warranties.</p><p>However, the TII Falcon LLM License introduces additional commercial use terms that require commercial applications to pay a 10% license fee on annual revenues in excess of $1 million. It also places additional restrictions on the manner in which the work may be published or distributed, such as emphasizing the need for attribution to &quot;Falcon LLM technology from the Technology Innovation Institute.&quot;</p><p><strong>The purpose of open-source for LLMs of open-source is different from that of traditional open-source software</strong></p><p>In the case of Llama2, for example, the license is essentially a guiding framework for organizations that intend to develop and deploy AI systems while adhering to Meta&#39;s established specifications and standards. The purpose of this framework is to ensure that these organizations meet specific rules and standards set by Meta when developing and deploying AI technologies. Such an approach helps Meta manage the scope and manner in which its AI technology is applied, thereby safeguarding its business interests and brand image.</p><p>The Llama2 license may constitute a compliance requirement that must be adhered to for those who plan to conduct AI development on the Meta platform. This means that these organizations must follow Meta&#39;s specific specifications and requirements when using Meta-provided tools and resources to develop and deploy AI models. In doing so, these companies may need to apply to Meta for the appropriate licenses, of which the Llama2 license is a part.</p><h4 id="_3-2-4-means-of-securing-controllable-licenses" tabindex="-1">3.2.4 Means of securing controllable licenses <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-4-means-of-securing-controllable-licenses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.4 Means of securing controllable licenses&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>Document the use of open source components</strong></p><p>When the enterprise or individual user&#39;s software reaches a certain size, the burden of managing the included open-source components becomes heavier, which leads to infringement problems due to the inability to manage them in a timely manner. According to Synopsys, 89% of the codebase contains open-source code that has been out of date for at least four years, and 88% of the codebase contains components that have been inactive for the past 2 years and contain components that are not the latest version. In many cases, developers may have completely forgotten which open-source components have been used and are unable to react in a timely manner when licenses for those open-source components are updated, leading to infringement issues. Therefore, it becomes very necessary to manage open-source components in a reasonable way.</p><p>Developers can manually or automatically maintain a detailed dependency list of all used open-source components and their version information in the project&#39;s documentation. For example, in many programming languages, dependencies can be tracked using files such as requirements.txt (Python), package.json (Node.js), and so on.</p><p>Create an internal document or knowledge base that records all relevant information about the open-source components used, including their origin, license information, and how they are used, and regularly check their licenses for updates. Track in detail in the documentation which open-source components are used, and add comments in the corresponding places in the code to indicate this. Add the corresponding license website to the document to check it regularly and find out the changes of the license terms in time. Also document in your programming how you have complied with valid license conditions.</p><p>For larger volumes of development work, manually recorded text may not be able to meet the project requirements, at this time you can use related tools, such as code component analysis (SCA) software. These tools automatically identify and document the open-source components used in a project. They are usually able to provide detailed reports that include component license information, versions, and possible security vulnerabilities.</p><p><strong>Cautious use of supplementary coding tools</strong></p><p>Intelligent programming assistants such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot provide programming advice and code snippets by analyzing a large number of codebases and documentation. While these tools are extremely valuable in improving programming efficiency, there are several key points to consider when using the code they generate to avoid potential open-source license infringement issues：</p><ul><li><p>License Issues with Source Code：Assistive programming software may generate suggestions based on code in its training datasets. These training datasets may contain code from different open-source projects that may have various license requirements. Usually supplementary programming results do not index the corresponding licenses, and copyright issues may be involved if the generated code snippets are too close to the original code and are copied directly by the user.</p></li><li><p>Attribution of Responsibility：When using code generated by an intelligent programming assistant, it needs to be clear that the ultimate responsibility lies with the user. This means that the developer is responsible for the legality and suitability of the generated code. As a result, developers conduct regular code reviews, especially for sections generated using assisted programming, to ensure that they do not violate the terms of any open-source license.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Adequate code audits during mergers and acquisitions</strong></p><p>An adequate code audit during the M&amp;A process is essential, especially to avoid infringement issues involving open-source licenses. M&amp;A activities usually involve a thorough evaluation of the target company&#39;s assets, of which technology assets, especially software assets, occupy an important place. The following issues need to be highlighted in M&amp;A audits：</p><ul><li>Identifying Open-source Components：An important task of a code audit is to identify all open-source components used in the target company&#39;s products. This includes open-source libraries and frameworks that are used directly, as well as open-source software that is indirectly relied upon. Understanding these components and their versions is critical to assessing the associated license requirements.</li><li>Reviewing License Compliance：After confirming an open-source component, its corresponding license needs to be reviewed.

In particular, note that some licenses may have specific restrictions on commercial use or require disclosure of modified source code.</li><li>Assessing Risks and Responsibilities：During the audit, the legal and financial risks that may arise from non-compliance with open-source licenses should be assessed.

Since the technology is relatively new and there is no clear definition and specification, this paragraph lists the topics of greater concern to the relevant practitioners at the moment based on desk research, in the hope of triggering readers&#39; thinking, and welcomes discussion and feedback.</p><h4 id="_3-3-1-open-source-ai-poses-new-requirements-for-data-security" tabindex="-1">3.3.1 Open Source AI Poses New Requirements for Data Security <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-1-open-source-ai-poses-new-requirements-for-data-security" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.3.1 Open Source AI Poses New Requirements for Data Security&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Unlike traditional data security, since a large part of the output results of AI LLMs depends on the training dataset, issues such as the quality of the dataset and whether the dataset contains malicious data are particularly important for AI LLMs, especially open-source LLMs, because many of the datasets of the open-source LLMs provide data internally by the enterprise, and the cleansing, monitoring, and compliance can&#39;t be done as professionally as those of the professional closed-source LLM vendors.</p><p><strong>Improper handling of the training dataset triggers a range of biases</strong></p><p>Data bias occurs when certain elements in a data set are overemphasized or underrepresented. When training AI or machine learning models based on such biased data, it can lead to biased, unfair and inaccurate results.</p><ul><li><strong>Selective Bias</strong>：Some facial recognition systems, trained primarily on white images, have relatively low accuracy in recognizing faces of different races;</li><li><strong>Exclusionary Bias</strong>：This bias usually occurs at the data preprocessing stage, and if the data is based on stereotypes or false assumptions, then the results will be biased regardless of which algorithm is used;</li><li><strong>Observer Bias</strong>：Researchers may consciously or unconsciously bring their personal views into a research project, which can influence the results;</li><li><strong>Racial Bias</strong>：Racial bias occurs when a dataset is biased toward a particular group;</li><li><strong>Measurement Bias</strong>：This bias occurs when the data used for training does not match the data in the real world, or when incorrect measurements distort the data.</li></ul><p>These biases, when used maliciously, can lead to outputs that are significantly politically or racially biased, or data errors that can significantly affect the performance and credibility of the larger model.</p><p><strong>Training data sources should be taken into account when choosing a LLM of an open-source base</strong></p><p>Many of the LLM training data sources are obtained directly from the Internet via crawler tools, where discriminatory, hateful and offensive speech and information is prevalent. In practice, people read, comment, like and spread negative messages far more than positive ones. As a result, human-generated information sources have long been in a more chaotic and unhealthy state. LLMs in this environment may contribute to the spread of racial discrimination and disinformation by being influenced by such data.</p><p>Once the data source at the base of the LLM is contaminated, even if the enterprise itself is fine-tuned to use a perfect data source, it can lead to significant bias in the final output. Therefore, when choosing a LLM for the base, users should not only consider the performance of the LLM, but should also take the source of the training data into consideration. The focus should be on LLMs that select annotated datasets from multiple sources in a responsible manner, while considering bias minimization as a factor to focus on throughout the model building process and even after deployment.</p><h4 id="_3-3-2-the-extensive-use-of-open-source-ai-llms-raises-ethical-considerations-for-society" tabindex="-1">3.3.2 The extensive use of open-source AI LLMs raises ethical considerations for society <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-3-2-the-extensive-use-of-open-source-ai-llms-raises-ethical-considerations-for-society" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.3.2 The extensive use of open-source AI LLMs raises ethical considerations for society&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>The problem of LLM hallucinations can lead to serious consequences</strong></p><p>There is an unresolved problem with current LLMs - hallucinations. According to the Sail Lab at HIT (Harbin Institute of Technology), hallucination refers to &quot;text generation tasks in which unfaithful or meaningless text is sometimes produced. &quot;While hallucinatory texts are unfaithful and meaningless, they are often so readable due to the powerful context generation capabilities of the LLM that the reader is led to believe that they are based on the provided context, even though it is actually very difficult to find or verify that such a context actually exists. This phenomenon is similar to mental hallucinations that are difficult to distinguish from other &quot;real&quot; perceptions, and it is also difficult to capture hallucinatory texts at a glance.</p><p>There are many types of illusions and they are still emerging as the use of LLMs expands. The main types of common hallucinations are the following：</p><ul><li><strong>Logic Errors</strong>：The LLM makes logical errors in its reasoning, which results in outputs that seem reasonable but don&#39;t stand up to scrutiny;</li><li><strong>Fabricated Facts</strong>：The database of the LLM itself does not support its answer to this question, but since the LLM cannot define its own boundaries, it will confidently assert facts that simply do not exist;</li><li><strong>Data-Driven Bias</strong>：As mentioned in the previous section, due to the prevalence of certain data, the output of the model may be biased in certain directions, leading to erroneous results.</li></ul><p>False outputs due to LLM hallucinations may cause harm to some users who are convinced by them. On May 16, 2023, the World Health Organization issued a statement of caution on the use of AI LLM tools. They noted that while these tools facilitate access to health information and may enhance the efficiency of diagnosis, particularly in resource-poor areas, their use requires a rigorous assessment of potential risks. The World Health Organization further emphasized that rushing into the use of inadequately tested systems could lead to mistakes by healthcare professionals, harm to patients and reduced trust in AI technologies, which could undermine or delay the potential long-term benefits and applications of such technologies globally. <br></p><div style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:75%;"><table><thead><tr><th><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/commercialization/chapter_3/3-9.png" alt="image037"></th></tr></thead></table></div>',52),tt=a('<br><p>Since there is not yet a clear accountability entity for LLMs, and even more so for open-source LLMs, in the event of serious consequences, it will be very difficult for users who have suffered losses to defend their rights and their losses to be mitigated. Currently there are 2 pressing issues to be addressed in this regard：</p><ul><li>How LLMs hallucinations can be better addressed - technical aspects</li><li>How to define more clearly who is responsible for LLMs - legal aspects</li></ul><p><strong>Outputs from LLMs may output content that violates ethical laws</strong></p><p>At present, some LLMs lack content filtering mechanisms, resulting in output content that violates domestic laws and regulations, public order and morals, mainly containing the following situations：</p><ul><li><p>Copyright Issues：LLMs may generate content that contains or resembles copyrighted material. For example, the model may create text that is similar to pre-existing literary works, song lyrics, movie scripts, and so on.Such a generation may violate the rights of the original author or copyright holder, leading to legal disputes;</p></li><li><p>Territorial legislation：Different countries and regions have their own unique legal systems. For example, certain countries have stricter censorship of Internet content, such as explicit bans on politically sensitive content, religious messages or specific expressions on gender issues. When the LLM runs in these regions, the generated content must comply with local laws. For example, when someone asked an LLM &quot;how to cook wild giant salamander&quot;, the model answered &quot;braise it&quot; and even provided detailed steps. Such answers may mislead the questioner. As a matter of fact, wild giant salamander are Class II protected animals and should not be captured, killed or eaten.</p></li><li><p>Defamation and Misinformation：If model-generated content contains false accusations or defamatory statements about individuals or organizations, legal action may result. This places high demands on ensuring the accuracy and legitimacy of the content.</p></li></ul><p>In order to ensure compliance with various legal requirements, organizations using LLMs may need to put in place regulatory mechanisms, such as auditing generated content to ensure that it does not violate any legal requirements. Especially for open-source models used by enterprises, they are relatively more leniently scrutinized for content output, and enterprises need to pay extra attention to related issues to prevent getting into legal disputes and incurring losses. Here again, it can be summarized in 2 questions：</p><ul><li>How to Enhance Information Filtering Mechanisms for LLMs - Technical Aspects</li><li>How to define whether LLM output content is infringing and illegal - legal aspects</li></ul><p><strong>LLMs may exacerbate social divide</strong></p><p>The Secretary General of the Digital Economy Committee of the Beijing Computer Society has said：The potential security issues of LLMs are of particular concern for those who lack critical thinking and analytical skills, and who are not well-informed about paid knowledge and healthcare services. With the dramatic increase in the number of Internet users and the widespread use of mobile devices, such as cell phones, low-education and low-income populations are increasingly relying on these avenues for medical, educational, and daily life advice. However, large-scale generative language models may exacerbate discriminatory portrayals and social biases against these marginalized groups, deepen social divisions, increase the harm of misleading, malicious information, and raise the risk of disclosure and misuse of individuals&#39; real information.</p><p>The use of LLMs is like a double-edged sword; on the one hand, it can reintegrate network resources and improve the efficiency of information collection; on the other hand, it may exacerbate information barriers due to problems such as hallucinations and lead to the misinformation of many populations with scarce information sources. There are 2 issues that need to be addressed at this point：</p><ul><li>Enhancing public education that LLMs are not a panacea and need to be viewed with caution - Social communication aspect</li><li>How to ensure the quality of LLM training datasets and reduce their bias - technical aspect</li></ul><h2 id="_4-capital-market-situation-for-open-source-projects-1" tabindex="-1">4 Capital market situation for open source projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-capital-market-situation-for-open-source-projects-1" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4 Capital market situation for open source projects&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="_4-1-the-status-of-global-markets" tabindex="-1">4.1 The status of global markets <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1-the-status-of-global-markets" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.1 The status of global markets&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_4-1-1-global-vc-investment-declines-in-2023-but-aigc-is-in-the-spotlight" tabindex="-1">4.1.1 Global VC Investment Declines in 2023, but AIGC is in the Spotlight <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1-1-global-vc-investment-declines-in-2023-but-aigc-is-in-the-spotlight" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.1.1 Global VC Investment Declines in 2023, but AIGC is in the Spotlight&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Since 2023, volatility in global financial markets has increased due to growing interest rates, challenging economic conditions, geopolitical conflicts, and concerns about the stability of the international financial system, which has led to a bleak picture for the global VC capital markets.
