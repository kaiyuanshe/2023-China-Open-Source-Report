It took a lot of grit and determination, but ultimately it has been a rewarding experience. With the growing trend of people seeking AI help in various jobs, it&#39;s important to remember the value of human skill and effort. By choosing to write this introduction by hand, I&#39;m demonstrating my commitment to the importance of human creativity and ingenuity.&quot;I resisted the temptation to use ChatGPT and wrote this year&#39;s introduction manually. It required a lot of perseverance, but it&#39;s worth it. It seems like the trend of seeking AI assistance for various jobs is growing in 2023.&quot;It took me a lot of &quot;perseverance&quot; to resist the urge to use ChatGPT to help me write this year&#39;s introduction, so I&#39;m going to write it entirely by hand. This is actually one of the trends of 2023: more and more jobs, people are trying to seek AI help.</p><h3 id="ai-aigc" tabindex="-1">AI &amp; AIGC <a class="header-anchor" href="#ai-aigc" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;AI &amp; AIGC&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In 2023, we witnessed the birth of countless open-source big models, along with numerous popular GPT-based applications. Additionally, new terms and projects like AutoGPT, LangChain, CoT, and RAG emerged in various fields such as image generation, speech generation, code generation, and more. These developments have led to significant advancements in AI technology and open-source ecology.</p><p>In the annual open source report, drastic changes were observed from 2020 to 2022. However, in 2023, we saw a massive wave in IT technology and open-source ecology that will shape the future of the industry.</p><h3 id="about-omni-data" tabindex="-1">About Omni-Data <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-omni-data" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About Omni-Data&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This year&#39;s annual report on open source in China has a significant story to tell. For the first time, we were able to combine GitHub and Gitee data to create a comprehensive comparison and gain new insights. Some of the findings may challenge the &quot;prejudices&quot; that many people hold about China&#39;s open source activity and contribution. We will continue to expand our data sources to make them truly &quot;Global.&quot;</p><h3 id="how-does-the-open-source-community-tackle-those-toughest-challenges" tabindex="-1">How does the open source community tackle those toughest challenges? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-the-open-source-community-tackle-those-toughest-challenges" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How does the open source community tackle those toughest challenges?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In July 2023, the Linux Foundation organized the Open Source Congress in Geneva, Switzerland. The congress aimed to address pressing issues confronting the open source community, such as cybersecurity, the rise of techno-nationalism, the complexity of artificial intelligence, and the growing challenge of regulatory scrutiny. The congress invited 73 open source organizations, including KAIYUANSHE and the Open Atom Open Source Foundation, to send representatives to the meeting in Geneva.</p><p>The first open source &quot;congress&quot; was an ambitious endeavor, and it is just the beginning. The future will require open-source practitioners worldwide to work together better to address the challenges.</p><h3 id="how-has-the-year-gone-for-open-source-in-china" tabindex="-1">How has the year gone for open source in China? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-has-the-year-gone-for-open-source-in-china" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How has the year gone for open source in China?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Don&#39;t let statistics overshadow the bigger picture. My intuition tells me that while there is external heat, there is internal cooling. National policies, local policies, technical conferences, and community exchanges are vibrant and lively. However, the open-source community&#39;s development activity has slowed down in China and globally.</p><p>We cannot afford to be complacent or discouraged. Instead, we must evaluate objectively and avoid being too late. Let&#39;s strive for progress, not perfection.</p><p>As we approach 2023 and 2024, we must ask ourselves: what should we expect? Which directions should we pursue? How can we remain resilient in a rapidly changing world? Join me as we explore these questions together.</p><div style="text-align:right;"> Biaowei Zhuang, Executive Director, kaiyuanshe <p>January 14, 2024</p></div>',15),r=[i];function s(c,h,l,u,d,p){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const f=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
