Whether or not to limit the pace of AI development was discussed. At the same time, major geopolitical powers such as the EU, the US, and China focused on creating legislation to regulate AI. Furthermore, open-source technology played a crucial role in catalyzing the development of AI, leading to efforts to define open-source AI.</p><p>During 2023, major open-source foundations and organizations from around the globe held online and offline discussions. They aimed to encourage policymakers and legislators worldwide to work together to face the challenges brought by the new era of AI through open-source cooperation and reject techno-nationalism and geopolitical hostility. Despite their efforts, the fragmented global open-source communities, particularly those from Asia and China, still need to gain significant influence on policymakers. Therefore, more attention and collaboration are necessary to address this issue.</p><p>We have given more importance to the crucial events related to open-source AI governance this year.

Here are some of the major events and outcomes:</p><ul><li>The Rust programming language team faced internal disagreements and created a new Leadership Council to decentralize authority. External experts were attacked by some core members, causing them to leave and leading to resignations. These conflicts led to the announcement of a new programming language called Crab. Crab&#39;s developers wanted more support with Rust&#39;s design, aiming to be more flexible, efficient, and faithful to Rust&#39;s original intent and philosophy.</li><li>The Rust Foundation&#39;s new Trademark Policy sparked community opposition over concerns that it could limit Rust&#39;s growth and innovation. The Foundation apologized, acknowledged its shortcomings, and promised to revisit and revise the policy while engaging in more dialogue with the community.</li><li>The management of the Rust community faced issues again recently. The organizers of RustConf removed some scheduled keynote speakers without informing them, which led to an outcry and protests within the community. As a result, some well-known Rust developers and speakers decided to withdraw not only from RustConf, but also from the Rust community as a whole.</li><li>Graydon Hoare, the founder of the Rust language, said in an interview that he was helpless and frustrated by the conflict and division in the Rust community, and that he believed that Rust had deviated from his original vision and goals, and that he was no longer able to control and save Rust, and that he hoped that the community would solve the problem on its own and leave him alone.</li></ul><p>While the Rust language went through some community crises and governance changes in 2023, it also published a roadmap for 2024 that focuses on three directions: lowering the barrier to learning, expanding the ecosystem, and improving the development process.</p><p>The design team for the Rust language has stated that their goal is to simplify the program so that developers only have to deal with the inherent complexity of their domain and no longer have to deal with the unintended complexity of Rust, and also to give library authors more power and flexibility to meet the needs and innovations of their users.</p><p>In addition, some observers believe that the Rust language is evolving toward ease of use as it proves its stability, performance, and productivity in 2021. Rust will likely see explosive growth as the cost of learning and use decreases even further. The focus on security, concurrency, and performance, and the growing adoption of the language as a language designed not only for today&#39;s challenges but also for the challenges of the future, suggests that the Rust language will be here to stay, but that community governance will remain a top priority must be addressed.</p><h4 id="_3-1-2-controversies-in-the-red-hat-community" tabindex="-1">3.1.2 Controversies in the Red Hat community <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-1-2-controversies-in-the-red-hat-community" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.1.2 Controversies in the Red Hat community&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Red Hat sparked a storm in the open source world in 2023 involving the source distribution and licensing of its two Linux distributions, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) and CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System). Here are some of the major events and outcomes:</p><ul><li>Red Hat, a popular software company, recently made an announcement that it will no longer share the complete source code of RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) publicly. Instead, it will only provide patches and updates. Additionally, downstream distributions of RHEL (like CentOS, Rocky Linux, and AlmaLinux) will need to recompile and release their versions within 30 days to maintain compatibility and support for RHEL. This decision has caused controversy among the open-source community. Many believe that Red Hat&#39;s actions go against the principles of open-source software and that the company is prioritizing profits over the spirit of open-source. The decision has also created difficulties and pressure for downstream distributions of RHEL.</li><li>Red Hat has responded to this, stating that they have not broken their commitment to open source, but rather to protect the brand and quality of RHEL from some bad behavior and abuse, as well as to encourage more users and developers to use RHEL directly and enjoy the services and support it provides.</li><li>CentOS, as the most extensive downstream distribution of RHEL, has been hit the hardest. Its ecosystem and community are facing a crisis of fragmentation and decline, and some users and developers have turned to other Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, etc., believing that CentOS has already lost its meaning and value of existence.</li><li>Both Oracle and SUSE took advantage of the opportunity to mock and provoke Red Hat, stating that they would continue to support and maintain RHEL&#39;s downstream distributions and even invested heavily in creating their own RHEL offshoots, such as Oracle Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, in an attempt to capture RHEL&#39;s market and users.</li><li>Red Hat has released a statement once again to explain why they are changing their RHEL source code release strategy. According to the statement, the company is making this change to improve the security, stability, and reliability of RHEL. The change will also promote innovation and development of RHEL. Red Hat assures that they still respect and support the open source community and welcomes more collaboration and feedback from it.</li></ul><h3 id="_3-2-risk-governance" tabindex="-1">3.2 Risk Governance <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-risk-governance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2 Risk Governance&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_3-2-1-ethics-and-social-risks" tabindex="-1">3.2.1 Ethics and social risks <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-1-ethics-and-social-risks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.1 Ethics and social risks&quot;">​</a></h4><p>AI technology development and application have triggered several ethical, moral, and societal risk debates and concerns related to human safety, freedom, privacy, and responsibility.

Conversely, Hongyi Zhou, CEO of 360, believes that not developing AI is the biggest insecurity. According to him, AI can help humans solve many problems, and its use can be regulated through laws and regulations.</li><li><strong>A 22-word statement signed by nearly 400 experts and scholars in the field of AI</strong>, including Geoffrey Hinton, the godfather of AI, Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, and Ilya Sutskever, its Chief Scientist, warns that AI could extinguish the human race! It states: &quot;Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war&quot;.</li><li><strong>In July 2023, many open-source foundations and organizations from around the world held an international conference in Geneva</strong> with the aim of exploring the relationship between AI and open-source, including the challenges and opportunities involved. The conference concluded that open source is essential in promoting AI innovation and cooperation, and is an effective means of ensuring AI ethics and social responsibility. Many experts from around the globe pointed out that open source is an inevitable trend in the development of AI. They also highlighted that open source makes AI research and application more transparent, fair, and credible. It allows more people to participate and contribute to the development of AI, preventing monopolization and abuse of AI.</li><li><strong>Three Turing Award winners in the AI field - Andrew Ng, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio - engaged in a lively debate on social media</strong>. Their discussion focused on the U.S. government&#39;s restrictions and bans on AI technology. Andrew Ng criticized the U.S. bans, stating that they hinder the open exchange of AI and are detrimental to AI development and innovation. However, Hinton and Bengio argued that the U.S. bans are necessary controls on AI for security and ethical reasons.</li></ul><p>The emergence and utilization of AI technology reflect the diverse ideologies and values worldwide, and their influence on the ongoing humanitarian crisis. AI is not merely a technological issue, but also a political, economic, and social one that necessitates international consensus and cooperation for the creation of sustainable and equitable AI development.</p><h4 id="_3-2-2-ai-laws-regulations-and-policy-documents-are-emerging-globally" tabindex="-1">3.2.2 AI Laws, Regulations and Policy Documents are emerging globally <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-2-ai-laws-regulations-and-policy-documents-are-emerging-globally" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.2 AI Laws, Regulations and Policy Documents are emerging globally&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In 2023, several laws, regulations, and policy documents related to AI were issued on a global scale. These included:</p><ul><li>The Interim Measures for the Administration of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services were jointly announced by seven Chinese ministries and commissions, including China&#39;s National Internet Information Office.</li><li>The Global Initiative on Artificial Intelligence Governance was issued by the Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China&#39;s Committee on Cybersecurity and Informatization.</li><li>The Executive Order on Safe, Reliable, and Trustworthy AI issued by the U.S. White House.</li><li>The European Parliament, the EU member states, and the European Commission agreed upon the Artificial Intelligence Act.</li><li>The Bletchley Declaration is an international declaration signed by representatives of the governments of 28 countries and the EU.</li></ul><p>The documents of China&#39;s Global AI Governance Initiative and the European Union&#39;s Artificial Intelligence Act reflect the importance of promoting and protecting open source AI technology. For instance, China&#39;s initiative encourages the world to work together towards the healthy development of AI, sharing the knowledge and open sourcing AI technology. The EU&#39;s AI Act specifies that it does not apply to AI components provided under free and open source licenses unless they are part of a general base model or prohibited AI practices, or subject to transparency obligations as part of an AI system.</p><h4 id="_3-2-3-global-open-source-organizations-are-addressing-new-ai-governance-challenges" tabindex="-1">3.2.3 Global open-source organizations are addressing new AI governance challenges <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-3-global-open-source-organizations-are-addressing-new-ai-governance-challenges" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.3 Global open-source organizations are addressing new AI governance challenges&quot;">​</a></h4><p>In June 2023, the Open Source Initiative (OSI) initiated the Defining Open Source AI campaign, which included online and offline global discussions and events to address the challenges of open-source AI governance. During the campaign, Kaiyuanshe actively participated in the mailing list discussions and organized the translation of the webinar series.

The</p><p>China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) released a report titled &quot;Compilation of Trusted Open Source Large Model Cases (Phase I)&quot; in December 2023. The report provides a comprehensive overview of China&#39;s open-source large model industry, including technical aspects, application scenarios, business models, governance, and development trends. It serves as a reference guide for developing China&#39;s large model industry and analyzes the technology ecology of open-source large models and the industry chain.</p><h4 id="_3-2-4-open-source-ai-large-models-call-for-new-types-of-licenses" tabindex="-1">3.2.4 Open-source AI large models call for new types of licenses <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-4-open-source-ai-large-models-call-for-new-types-of-licenses" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.4 Open-source AI large models call for new types of licenses&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Open source is becoming mainstream for AI large models, but traditional licenses can&#39;t meet their unique needs. New licenses are being explored.</p><p>The Open Source Initiative declared Meta&#39;s LLaMa license not open source due to commercial use limitations and purpose of use restrictions. Falcon-40B was also challenged for using a custom license with special restrictions and had to change to Apache 2.0. Hugging Face changed TGI&#39;s license from Apache 2.0 to HFOIL due to restrictions on selling hosted or managed services on TGI.</p><p>By 2023, Hugging Face will have almost half a million models available with different licenses, including Apache 2.0, MIT, and OpenRAIL. The OpenRAIL license is an upgrade from RAIL and has behavioral restrictions. It includes licenses for source code, applications, models, and data: OpenRAIL-S, OpenRAIL-A, OpenRAIL-M, and OpenRAIL-D.</p><p>China&#39;s domestic standards and research institutions are actively promoting innovative AI licensing practices. In May 2023, the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology (CAICT) jointly compiled and released the &quot;Zhiyuan Open AI Model License Version 1.&quot; This license regulates the use of models (including their derivatives and supporting materials) but does not apply to the training data of the models. In August 2023, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Intelligent Court Research Institute, along with the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute and Shanghai Magnolia Open Source and Open Research Institute, organized a workshop on designing the framework of the Mulan-Magnolia Open Data License 2.0. The license&#39;s function is to provide an open license for AI data. In December 2023, the OpenAtom Open Source Foundation and the Magnolia Open Source Community, the OpenI Qizhi Community, and other communities jointly developed the Mulan-Qizhi Model License (Beta). The license applies to models obtained through algorithmic training and supplementary materials, including model structure, parameters, weights, etc. However, it excludes the training models&#39; algorithms and algorithmic source code.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Commentary</strong>: Wei Jianfan: I believe that these disputes will soon cease to exist, and as long as the law is clear, all similar problems will be solved.</p></blockquote><h4 id="_3-2-5-the-development-of-china-s-open-source-field-standard-is-gaining-momentum" tabindex="-1">3.2.5 The development of China&#39;s open-source field standard is gaining momentum. <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-2-5-the-development-of-china-s-open-source-field-standard-is-gaining-momentum" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3.2.5 The development of China&#39;s open-source field standard is gaining momentum.&quot;">​</a></h4><p>China supports open-source standards and will develop standards for open-source terminology, licenses, interoperability, project maturity, community operation, governance, and supply chain management for open-source software.</p><p>A new national standard for evaluating the open source code security of software products was drafted in April 2023 by the National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee, led by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. It is now open for public comment.</p><p>In July 2023, the Chinese Electronics Industry Standardization Technology Association (CESTA) approved three group standards related to open-source technology. These standards provide guidelines for open-source governance and project evaluation.

Open Source Security Chronicle <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-open-source-security-chronicle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4. Open Source Security Chronicle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In today&#39;s digital age, software has become an essential element that supports the normal functioning of our society. However, as the software supply chain becomes more complex, so do the security issues. The Log4Shell vulnerability recently brought open-source security into the spotlight. Despite 2022 being touted as the &quot;Year of Supply Chain Security,&quot; the vulnerability is still widespread, and the rate of adoption of fixes is low. As a result, the frequency of attacks in the software supply chain has skyrocketed. The broad adoption of open-source code has turned supply chain security into an existential issue. Log4Shell has made headlines as it revealed the security risks present in the open-source community. Moreover, other projects that are heavily reliant on open-source in the ecosystem may have a more extensive reach and more severe consequences than Log4Shell. Supply chain attacks are on a sharp upward trend, averaging 742% annual growth since 2019. Therefore, we need to focus on improving the security of open-source software.</p><h3 id="_4-1-latest-trends-and-challenges" tabindex="-1">4.1 Latest trends and challenges <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1-latest-trends-and-challenges" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.1 Latest trends and challenges&quot;">​</a></h3><p>An analysis of the latest trends and challenges in open-source security, including the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Malware as a Service</strong>: Hackers use open source code and tools to develop and distribute malware, creating a massive black market that threatens the security of the open source ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Human Errors</strong>: Open-source projects are vulnerable to attacks due to human errors, such as ignoring security updates, using weak passwords, and leaking sensitive information by developers and maintainers working with open-source code.</li><li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks</strong>: occur when hackers inject malicious code into open-source projects by manipulating repositories, dependency packages, or update channels, thereby compromising the reliability and trust of these projects.</li><li><strong>Legal Risks</strong>: Open source projects may face legal risks in complying with license agreements, dealing with copyright disputes, responding to policy changes, etc., which must be identified and resolved promptly.</li><li><strong>Security Standards</strong>: Open-source communities and organizations are developing and promoting some security standards and best practices, such as SLSA, OpenSSF, CII, etc., to improve the quality and security of open-source code.</li><li><strong>Security Tools</strong>: Open source projects can utilize some open source or commercial security tools, such as Snyk, Dependabot, CodeQL, etc., to detect and fix security vulnerabilities and improve security protection.</li><li><strong>Security Education</strong>: Open source projects need to strengthen security education and training, improve the security awareness and skills of developers and maintainers, establish a security culture and process, and prevent security risks.</li><li><strong>Security Cooperation</strong>: Open source projects must strengthen security cooperation with other open source projects, organizations, enterprises, governments, etc., share security information and resources, form a security community, and jointly address security threats.</li><li><strong>Security Outlook</strong>: The security landscape for open-source projects presents a mixed prospect.

The prevailing argument and accompanying legislation state that the authors of open-source software bear responsibility for any vulnerabilities detected in the code. Despite being offered free of charge, the authors are expected to guarantee the quality and security of their software. Vulnerabilities can cause significant harm, such as the compromise of user data and system attacks, making it imperative for authors to fix identified weaknesses and inform users promptly and swiftly. As such, the current trend in global legislation is to hold open-source legally accountable for cybersecurity.</p><ul><li>In <strong>China</strong>, providers of network products and services are forbidden from developing malicious programs. They must take immediate corrective action, promptly notify users according to regulations, and report to the relevant authorities if security flaws, loopholes, or risks are identified in their network products and services. Furthermore, network product and service providers must maintain ongoing security for their products and services. They are not permitted to terminate the provision of security maintenance within the period specified or agreed upon by the parties. If a network product or service can collect user information, its provider must obtain explicit consent and communicate this to users. Moreover, if personal information is involved, the provider must comply with the relevant laws and administrative regulations on personal information protection.</li><li><strong>The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)</strong> aims to strengthen the cybersecurity of digital products in the EU by consolidating the existing cybersecurity regulatory framework. The Act imposes many cybersecurity requirements on digital products, including software. The Act is closely linked to the Highly Common Cybersecurity Directive (NIS 2 Directive), the Cybersecurity Act, the Artificial Intelligence Act, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It could become one of the most critical EU cybersecurity laws.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-3-some-important-open-source-security-incidents-in-2023" tabindex="-1">4.3 Some important open source security incidents in 2023 <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3-some-important-open-source-security-incidents-in-2023" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.3 Some important open source security incidents in 2023&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_4-3-1-log4j-vulnerability-resurrection" tabindex="-1">4.3.1 Log4j vulnerability resurrection <a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3-1-log4j-vulnerability-resurrection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;4.3.1 Log4j vulnerability resurrection&quot;">​</a></h4><p>LLog4j is a tool for developers to track their programs.

Open Source Education Chronicle <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-open-source-education-chronicle" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6. Open Source Education Chronicle&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the China Open Source Annual Report, a new element, &quot;Open Source Education,&quot; has been added to its list of milestones for the year. The definition of open-source education may vary among distinct organizations. This chapter aims to provide unambiguous clarity by defining open-source education as the utilization of open-source software and open educational resources to support educational goals. <strong>This encompasses the utilization of open-source software tools, teaching materials, and instructional resources, while promoting knowledge sharing and collaboration. One of the primary objectives of open-source education is to offer more inclusive and equitable educational opportunities, thereby enabling more individuals to access high-quality educational resources.</strong></p><p>In the open-source education model, educational resources like teaching plans, course content, and software tools are openly available to everyone. This means that anyone can use, modify, and share them. This model is highly beneficial in fostering students&#39; innovative thinking, collaborative skills, and problem-solving abilities. By participating in open-source projects, students can gain exposure to the latest technologies and tools in the industry. They can also get a better understanding of the actual process of software development and contribute their own strengths to the open-source community.</p><p>At the same time, as the drafting party of the report, &quot;Open Source Education&quot; is not unfamiliar to the Open Source Society. Since its establishment in 2014, the Open Source Society has actively explored the integration of open source and education. Before formally introducing the milestones of open source education in 2023, let&#39;s review the work done by the Open Source Society in the field of open source education:</p><ul><li>In 2014, the Open Source Society initiated the first series of open source on-campus activities in China—&quot;Open Sourcers on Tour&quot;;</li><li>In 2017, the Open Source Society&#39;s executive committee established working groups dedicated to open-source education, such as the Open Education Group and University Collaboration Group;</li><li>In 2018, the Open Source Society held the third China Open Source Conference (COSCon&#39;18), which produced China&#39;s first &quot;Open Source Education Track&quot;;</li><li>In 2019, the Open Source Society, in partnership with East China Normal University, established China&#39;s first &quot;Open Source Education Fund&quot;;</li><li>In 2020, the Open Source Society produced the &quot;Open Source Bootcamp&quot; series, aiming to provide introductory training for open source education;</li><li>In 2021, the Open Source Society invited six guests to share their insights on open-source education at the sixth China Open Source Conference (COSCon&#39;21), and for the first time, invited open-source students from universities to discuss open-source education topics;</li><li>In 2022, the Open Source Society actively began to explore directions related to open source education and training, such as specialized corporate open source training;</li><li>In 2023, the Open Source Society, for the first time, set up a &quot;Youth Open Source Education&quot; track at the eighth China Open Source Conference (COSCon&#39;23), inviting young students from primary and secondary schools to share their views on open source.</li></ul><p>The integration of open-source principles with education has significantly deepened over the years. The Open Source Organization&#39;s development in &quot;Open Source Education&quot; has expanded the audience for open-source education from open-source communities to higher education institutions, secondary and primary schools, and even to a broader demographic of employed individuals.</p><p>Despite this progress, there is still a global need for more skilled open-source professionals. The Linux Foundation&#39;s &quot;10th Annual Open Source Jobs Report&quot; reveals that 93% of employers struggle to find professionals with adequate open-source skills, and the situation is not improving. Nearly half of these employers (46%) plan to increase their recruitment of open-source talent in the next six months. Additionally, 73% of open-source professionals report ease in finding new employment opportunities to continue their open-source endeavors.</p><p>This talent scarcity has elevated the importance of open-source education worldwide. China is actively fostering its open-source education landscape by encouraging participation in open-source community activities, soliciting contributions to open-source projects, establishing robust open-source education systems, and setting standards for evaluating open-source competencies. These efforts aim to stimulate a thriving open-source ecosystem and nurture talent. By doing so, students and professionals can gain a more profound understanding of the ethos behind open-source software, facilitating the integration of theory with practice, enhancing educational quality, and meeting the societal demand for innovative individuals.</p><p>Lastly, let&#39;s review the significant milestones in China&#39;s open-source education journey during 2023.</p><h3 id="_6-1-open-source-education-has-been-thriving-with-interactive-practices-project-based-learning-and-innovation-competitions" tabindex="-1">6.1 Open-source education has been thriving with interactive practices, project-based learning, and innovation competitions <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-1-open-source-education-has-been-thriving-with-interactive-practices-project-based-learning-and-innovation-competitions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6.1 Open-source education has been thriving with interactive practices, project-based learning, and innovation competitions&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In 2023, China saw a significant increase in open-source educational activities.

Together, they explore new paths of industry-education integration by establishing university open-source communities, popularizing open-source culture, and developing open-source curriculum systems.</li></ul></li><li><strong>CCF Open Source Development Committee</strong><ul><li>The &quot;Open Source University Tour&quot; series initiated by the Open Source Development Committee of the China Computer Federation was successfully held at prestigious universities like Tsinghua, Peking, Beihang, and Fudan, leaving a significant impact and achieving successful practices.</li></ul></li><li><strong>OSPP Organizing Committee</strong><ul><li>To enable more students to understand and participate in open-source projects deeply, the OSPP organizing committee partnered with many excellent open-source communities to launch the &quot;OSPP Campus Tour.&quot; The OSPP Campus Tour series aims to ignite the energy and vitality of the new generation of developers, allowing more students to gain an in-depth understanding of well-known open-source technologies, projects, and communities both domestically and internationally and to popularize open-source culture in more universities.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Hongshan Open Source</strong><ul><li>The Hongshan Open Source community launched the &quot;Hongshan Open Source University Tour&quot; for key universities and directions, enhancing the community&#39;s influence and popularity and attracting more outstanding innovative resources to construct the open-source creation ecosystem.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Such activities are expected to become one of the main channels through which college students can access open-source education in the future.</p><h3 id="_6-8-china-s-policies-related-to-open-source-education" tabindex="-1">6.8 China&#39;s policies related to open-source education <a class="header-anchor" href="#_6-8-china-s-policies-related-to-open-source-education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;6.8 China&#39;s policies related to open-source education&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In 2023, while notable advancements were made in the practical application of open-source education in China, supportive policies at the national level were relatively scarce.</p><p>Certain local governments, however, have started to recognize and foster the growth of open-source education. For instance, on December 29, 2022, the Changfeng Alliance Think Tank Base submitted &quot;Suggestions for Strengthening Open-Source Talent Education in Beijing,&quot; which systematically addresses open-source talent education&#39;s current state and challenges. The proposal advocates for enhancing open-source talent training by the Beijing municipal government. As a leading hub for China&#39;s open-source ecosystem, Beijing&#39;s role in advancing open-source talent education is pivotal, contributing to the cultivation of software talent aligned with industrial demands, establishing a sustainable open-source ecosystem, and enhancing software technological innovation and supply capabilities.</p><p>Furthermore, the &quot;Guide for the Construction of Demonstration Software Colleges with Characteristics (Trial)&quot; jointly issued by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in 2020 has prompted universities to engage more deeply in open-source education. The guide underscores the importance of cultivating software talent with distinctiveness, exploring professional development patterns, and focusing on the specific needs of open-source talent in critical areas such as foundational software, industrial software, and emerging platforms. It also encourages cultivating vital open-source projects and gathering outstanding talent, providing robust support for industrial innovation.</p><p>Despite the limited dissemination of policy-related messages in 2023 (which may be amid formulation), existing policy documents have already positively impacted open-source education. As we look ahead to 2024, more national-level policies are anticipated to be released, further guiding and promoting the practice of open-source education in China.</p><h2 id="_7-open-source-ranklists-and-reports-summary" tabindex="-1">7.
