# OSS Questionnaire

## 1. Background

As a continuation of the tradition since the release of the China Open Source Community Survey 2015 in early 2016, at the end of 2023 we launched another annual participatory survey of Chinese open source communities, dedicated to presenting the overall state of open source development in China in a multi-dimensional manner through continued developer survey reports.Using tools such as data analysis and survey reports, we have succeeded in producing a map of China’s open-source world in 2023.

The questionnaire addresses the multiple roles of the interviewees and aims to gain insight into community development trends at various levels.Based on the level of participation of the open source community, the respondents are divided into several roles: users, participants, contributors, maintainers, and ecosystem operators.This shapes onion model and layer evolution.The four role levels are defined as：

- User：users who have used one or more open-source products
- Participant：Users who interact with the open source community (e.g. communication with open source communities, participation in activities of open source community organizations, etc.)
- Contributor: Users who contribute substantially to the open source community(including code and non-code contributions.)
- Maintainer：Users primarily responsible for daily operations to the open source community (including project maintainer, PCC members, etc.)

In addition, ecosystem operators are the users who are primarily responsible for day-to-day operations in the open source communities, at a level above the participants and collectively referred to as operators.In addition to raising basic questions for all interviewees, the questionnaire addresses several different roles for users, contributors and operators.

The **basic information** for this questionnaire is as follows：

- **Audiences** ：covers developers, community members, contributors, students, government and enterprise mangagement personnel.
- **Topics** ：mainly covers personal information, work status, open source communities, developer technologies, etc.
- **Method** ：Collects samples and data using online questionnaires to analyze data across comparisons
- **Channels** ：KAIYUANSHE, KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China, 2023 Eighth Annual Open Source Conference in China, 2023 Open Atomic Developers Conference, 2023 Open Source Industry Ecology Conference
- **Question Type** \* ：single-choice, multiple-choice, open-ended
- **Number of Questions** ：43
- **Sample Quantity** ：875

## 3. Analysis of the Questionnaire

### 3.1 Features of the Interviewee

First, we conduct surveys from the point of view of age, gender, academic qualifications, resident city, industry and professional identity, through which basic information about participants can be obtained, thus analysing the identity of the audience groups in open source communities.

#### 3.1.1 Age, Gender, Education, City

|                                Age                                |                                Gender                                |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-1.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-2.png" width="700"> |


The age distribution of respondents to this questionnaire is similar to that of previous years, mainly in the 21-50 age group, with a more balanced age distribution.It is worth noting that the proportion of respondents under 21 years of age is 25.71%, a significant increase from 8.42% last year.The participation of young respondents in the table has increased considerably.

In terms of gender, male respiondents account for a higher proportion, reaching 73.37%, while females accout for 25.83%. Compared to last year's questionnaire, the proportion of women and men interviewed has increased significantly and is consistent with the current lack of gender balance among developers.

|                                Educational background                                |                                Region                                |

The majority of the respondents are in the Internet/IT / electronic/ communications industry, accounting for 72.23%, indicating that the survey primarily covers the field of science and technology.

In terms of professional status, 43.20% of students are in school, followed by back-end developers, architects and academic researchers. Overall, the respondents are predominantly technical practitioners and students and cover a number of occupations in computer industries.

### 3.2 Open source participation

#### 3.2.1 Level of participation by open source communities

|       Role of open source communities      |               Time to contact open source              |
| :----------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-7.png"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-8.png" width="700"> |

The survey shows that the vast majority of members of open source communities are users (73.37%), while close to half of the participants (49.03%) and some contributors (26.51%).

Regarding the duration of involvement in open source, one-third of respondents have been involved in open source communities for less than a year, while nearly half have more than 3 years of experience.

We have cross-analyze the question "To what extent do you think you are a member of an open source community" with interviewees' roles in an open source community.

| Extend of Considering Oneself a Part of the Open Source Community |
| :------------------------------------------------------: |
|  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.1-9.png" width="700">  |

It can be seen that there is a greater sense of belonging among the maintainers, contributors, ecosystem operators than participants and users in the open source community.

The following questions were addressed to respondents who had a role in the open source community at the “user” level and above.

#### 3.2.2 Use of Open Source Products

|        Reason for Selecting Open Source Products       |               Factors Influencing Choice               |

The main reason that users chose to use open source software is free of charge for their products, followed by further development and a favourable community environment.

In selecting open source products, participants are more focused on the level of code regulation and the activity of developers. This indicates that users are concerned not only about the functionality and quality of open source products, but also about the activity of communities and developers and the sustainability of projects.

|         Issues Encounterred When Using Open Source Products        |    Factors Prompting Open Source Contributions   |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |

Interviewees contribute to open source projects mainly by writing codes and documents. In addition, open source advocacy, open source community operations and facilitating community activities are also common contribution methods.

The types of open-source project that contributed are mainly concentrated in library/middleware and common framework/infrastructure, reflecting developers' deep interest in foundational technologies.

#### 3.3.4 Incentives

|                       Incentives                       |               Sources of Financial Return              |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.3-7.png" width="700"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.3-8.png" width="400"> |

Various incentives have been positively evaluated, indicating that the diversity of incentives has had a positive impact on open source participation by developers. In particular, respondents believe that incentives for honour and social interaction have a more significant positive impact on contributions.

More than half of the developers participating in open source projects receive no financial rewards.The rest of the developers receive direct financial returns through compensation/salary, rewards/incentives, while very few developers receive financial support through advertising revenue, donations, and patent/intellectual property income.

### 3.4 Community Operations Survey

This section of the question is addressed to interviewees who are “operators” in the open-source community.

#### 3.4.1 Overview of Open Source Communities

|                Number of Community Users               |                    Active Developers                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-1.png" width="300"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-2.png" width="250"> |

Nearly 60% of operators belong to open source communities with fewer than 200 users, while almost 30% belong to communities with over 500 users. More than half of the operators belong to the communities with  fewer than 20 active developers.

#### 3.4.2 Open Source Community Management

|               Community Management                      |             Community Commercial Support               |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-3.png" style="width:500px;"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com//kaiyuanshe/2023-China-Open-Source-Report/main//public/image/questionnaire/3.4-4.png" style="width:300px;"> |

About half of the communities have clear governance structures and professionals responsible for day-to-day operations. At the same time, communities have generally developed clear norms and provided updated documentation to support member inclusion.

Most open source communities have commercial support and are mainly in the form of declarations and synergistic development.

#### 3.4.3 Research on the Commercailization of Open Source Software

|      Usage of Open Source Software in Enterprise       |    Agreement with commercialization of Open Source Projects   |
| :----------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------: |
